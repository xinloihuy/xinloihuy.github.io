# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My SOC & Blue Team Journey

Welcome to my blog!  
This site is where I document and share my learning progress in **Blue Teaming** and **Security Operations (SOC)**.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Write-ups
Write-ups for CTF challenges, SOC investigations, and labs from training platforms.  
These focus on log analysis, alert triage, and incident response methodology.

**Examples:**
- [WebStrike Lab (CyberDefenders.org)](./posts/webstrike-lab.md)
- [Phishing Email Analysis (BlueTeamLabs Online)](./posts/phishing-lab.md)
- [SIEM Detection Challenge (CyberDefenders.org)](./posts/siem-detection.md)

> ðŸ”¹ *Goal: Document lessons learned and detection approaches used in real SOC environments.*

---

## ðŸ§ª Personal Labs
My self-built mini-labs to simulate real-world Blue Team scenarios.  
These are hands-on experiments to understand system behavior, attacker activity, and defense mechanisms.

**Topics Include:**
- Building a small Splunk + Sysmon lab  
- Analyzing network traffic with Wireshark  
- Investigating malicious PowerShell activity  
- Detecting persistence with Windows Event Logs

> ðŸ”¹ *Goal: Strengthen detection and analysis skills through practical, repeatable setups.*

---

## ðŸ’¼ Mini Projects
Mini projects and proof-of-concepts (PoCs) demonstrating applied SOC and Blue Team skills.  
These are designed to show practical ability for **internships** or **SOC analyst roles**.

**Example Projects:**
- SOC Alert Dashboard using Elastic Stack  
- Phishing Detection and Reporting System  
- Automation script for IOC lookup and enrichment  

> ðŸ”¹ *Goal: Showcase end-to-end understanding â€” from log collection to threat detection.*

## ðŸ§­ Roadmap
Planned upcoming content:
- More detailed CyberDefenders walkthroughs  
- SIEM detection rule development  
- Incident investigation reports  
- Home SOC setup guide
